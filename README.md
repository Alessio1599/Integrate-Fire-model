# Neural Systems: Integrate-and-Fire Model

This repository contains a simulation of two integrate-and-fire neurons coupled through synaptic conductances. The neurons are analyzed for their response to a constant input current, and the synchrony of their spikes is evaluated.

## Description

The model includes:
- Two neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
- Refractory periods modeled by variable thresholds.
- Constant input currents applied to each neuron.
- Analysis of the neurons' membrane potentials, spike trains
