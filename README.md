# Neural Systems: Integrate-and-Fire Model

This repository contains a simulation of two integrate-and-fire neurons coupled through synaptic conductances. The neurons are analyzed for their response to a constant input current, and the synchrony of their spikes is evaluated.




## Description

The model includes:
- Two neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
- Refractory periods modeled by variable thresholds.
- Constant input currents applied to each neuron.
- Analysis of the neurons' membrane potentials, spike trains

### Parameters of the model
- $\Delta p_{s}=0.03-0.06$
- $\tau_{s}=10 ms$
- $ri=25 mV$
- $rg_{s,max}=0.5-5$
